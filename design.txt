Design of pipeShell



main

	declare constants & variables

	while user input is not "exit" or "quit"
		
		count arguments in each argument set based on "|" and " "

		if argument set is 1

			fork one child and execute

			have parent wait for child to finish

		if argument sets are greater than 1

			call function for at least one pipe



function for at least one pipe

	create appropriate number of pipes

	fork a first child for first argument

		close unused ends of pipes, dup and execute argument

	fork middle children if necessary

		close unused ends of pipes, dup and execute argument

	fork a last child for last argument
		
		close unused ends of pipes, dup and execute argument
